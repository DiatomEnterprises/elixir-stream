  <h4>What is ElixirStream?</h4>
  <br/>
  <p>
    For more than half a year a group of our developers has been researching Elixir programming language. Now here at <b><a href="http://www.diatomenterprises.com/">Diatom</a></b>, we strongly believe that Elixir is "The Next big Thing", so we've decided to give our community a boost and create a link-sharing platform. 
  </p>
  <p>
    “So, how is this platform different from other platforms like Reddit, Elixir mailing lists, blog aggregators, etc.?” you might ask. The answer is - our goal is to bring news, share at the single place and have fun along the way. Self-promotion is more than welcome here. Thus, feel free to share your posts!
