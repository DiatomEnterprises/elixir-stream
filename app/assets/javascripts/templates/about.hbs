  <h4>What is ElixirStream?</h4>
  <br>
  <p>Here at <b><a href="http://www.diatomenterprises.com/">Diatom</a></b> we belive that Elixir is "The next big thing" so we decided to give our community a boost and create link sharing platform</p>
  <p>So how this is different from Reddit, Elixir mailing lists, bloag aggregators e.t.c? </p>
  <p>Simply, our goal is to bring news, sharing on single place and have fun along the way.</p>
